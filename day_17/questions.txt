Write a c program for the following using basic concepts and dynamic memory allocation. Take USER DEFINED INPUTS FOR ALL

1.to allocate an array using malloc and perform pointer arithmetic to modify and print the elements.
 Finally print the sum of the elements in the array

2.create a simple calculator using pointer function in which we have to define add substract multiply and divide functions. 
Define  function pointers that can point to these functions. Appropriate function will be called using function pointer.

3. to input a string and reverse it 

4.create an array of 5 elements using malloc, use memset() to initialize all the elements of array to 0.
 Input 5 elements and find sum of all the elements of the array.

5.create an array of 5 elements using calloc, use memset() to initialize all the elements of array to 0. 
Input 5 elements and find sum of all the elements of the array.
